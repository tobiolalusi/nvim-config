# Installation
The preliminary requirement is the installation of
[Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim) (`nvim`).

Once you have Neovim, clone this repository into `~/.config/nvim`.
```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/tobiolalusi/nvim-config.git .
```
After installation is complete, open nvim and execute the command
`:PackerSync` in order to install all the necessary plugins.\
After the sync, this nvim configuration should be running properly.
